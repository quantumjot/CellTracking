# CellTracking

*Please note, this is just a landing page for our cell tracking software projects*

The cell tracking pipeline consists of several libraries:

### Data acquisition
+ OctopusLite (https://github.com/quantumjot/OctopusLite)

### Image analysis and cell tracking
+ cellx (https://github.com/quantumjot/cellx)
+ CNN-annotator (https://github.com/lowe-lab-ucl/cnn-annotator)
+ BayesianTracker (https://github.com/quantumjot/BayesianTracker)
+ Arboretum (https://github.com/quantumjot/Arboretum)

### Explainable AI models
+ cellx-predict (https://github.com/lowe-lab-ucl/cellx-predict)

### Cell cycling & lineage tree analysis 
+ DeepTree (https://github.com/KristinaUlicna/DeepTree)

### Cell neighbourhood and fate analysis
+ Neighbourhood analysis and Chessplots (https://github.com/DGradeci/Chessplots)
